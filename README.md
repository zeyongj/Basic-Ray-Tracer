# Basic Ray Tracer

## Introduction
- SFU CMPT 361: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Individual Project: Basic Ray Tracer via C++ and OpenGL.
- This project is to implement a basic ray tracer, completed in Euclidean space. There is no need for homogeneous coordinates.
- After I enter the arguments 1 to 4, the graphs that I generated are S1.jpg to S4.jpg respectively.
- All the graphs are taken by the screenshot.
- I set the executable as `rayT`.

## Execution

- Compile: `make`.
- Run: `./rayT`.

- I would like express my appreciation to the authors.

## Disclaimer

**This repository is *ONLY* for backup. Students should *NEVER* use this repository to finish their works, *IN ANY WAY*.**

It is expected that within this course, the highest standards of academic integrity will be maintained, in
keeping with SFU’s Policy S10.01, `Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct`.

In this class, collaboration is encouraged for in-class exercises and the team components of the assignments, as well
as task preparation for group discussions. However, individual work should be completed by the person
who submits it. Any work that is independent work of the submitter should be clearly cited to make its
source clear. All referenced work in reports and presentations must be appropriately cited, to include
websites, as well as figures and graphs in presentations. If there are any questions whatsoever, feel free
to contact the course instructor about any possible grey areas.

Some examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- Handing in assignments/exercises that are not 100% your own work (in design, implementation,
  wording, etc.), without a clear/visible citation of the source.
- Using another student's work as a template or reference for completing your own work.
- Using any unpermitted resources during an exam.
- Looking at, or attempting to look at, another student's answer during an exam.
- Submitting work that has been submitted before, for any course at any institution.

All instances of academic dishonesty will be dealt with severely and according to SFU policy. This means
that Student Services will be notified, and they will record the dishonesty in the student's file. Students
are strongly encouraged to review SFU’s Code of Academic Integrity and Good Conduct (S10.01) available
online at: http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html.
